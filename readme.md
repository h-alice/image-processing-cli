# Image Processor in GoLang

Image batch processing in Go.

## Scenario: About the project
This project is mainly for processing my artworks, which can cost a plenty of time to do it manually in regular painting software.  
I implemented some basic image processing operations (such as resizing, cropping, ICC profile embedding, etc.) in GoLang to automate the process.(Why not Python? Speed matters.)!  
The project is still under development, and I will add more features in the future.
